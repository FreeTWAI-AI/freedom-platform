# Commerce storefront buyer pages

Buyer pages under `/shops/:slug` that need browser code, and the storefront
client bundle they share (EC-SPEC-01 §3, EC-SPEC-02 §4.2 and §6).

- Server HTML for these pages lives in this directory. The routes stay in
  `apps/platform-api/src/routes/hosted-store.ts` next to the other `/shops`
  pages.
- The client entry lives in `apps/portal-web/src/storefront/`. Vite emits it
  under the fixed name `assets/storefront.js`, which is served `no-store` like
  the other fixed-name files. It uses only the `shop-` styles in `/shops.css`
  and never loads the portal app, themes, navigation or chat.
- Orders are read only through the public checkout API (`hosted-checkout`).
  The pages show no data that the API did not return.
- Before Ted authorises `FREEDOM_COMMERCE_EMAIL_ENABLED`, B10 shows the
  EC-SPEC-10 §6.2 explanation and collects no Email.

Status: `pages.ts` renders the B07 order shell (`orderPageHtml`), the 404 order-missing page (`orderMissingHtml`) and the B10 order-access guidance page (`orderAccessPageHtml`); `apps/portal-web/src/storefront/main.tsx` mounts `#shop-order` to redeem one-time links, display pre-payment/paid/cancelled orders and forget browser device access.
