# Contract release verification and development context

This directory defines the development schemas for the unified-foundation governance work. The first implementation verifies legacy preview pins and signed ReleaseSet pins locally. It does **not** configure a trusted publisher, GitHub protection, runtime authorization, or production signing.

The source schemas are in [schemas](schemas). The shared implementation is in [packages/contribution-tools](../packages/contribution-tools); consumers receive exact committed copies through the existing export command. Do not create a second consumer-owned verifier or change the preview bundle to enable execution.

## Local checks

```sh
npm run test:governance
npm run contracts:build
git diff --exit-code -- contracts/preview/v1 packages/sdk
```

The tests use synthetic repositories, ephemeral in-memory signing keys and temporary files. They do not connect to a database, provider, R2 or GitHub. Existing preview bytes are used for compatibility tests.

## Development entrypoints

```sh
node scripts/freedom.mjs prepare --base-ref origin/main --scope assets,member-card
node scripts/freedom.mjs context --base-ref origin/main --paths apps/portal-web/src/modules/Membership.tsx
node scripts/freedom.mjs verify --base-ref origin/main --report .freedom/reports/current.json
```

Run from the repository root with Node 24. `prepare` writes an ignored, task-scoped context bundle; `context` prints the full applicable content; `verify` runs the implemented local checks and optionally saves a report. Exit codes are 0 (complete for the requested local scope), 1 (failed), and 2 (required evidence unavailable). None of these results is a trusted merge or execution authorization.

Context contains repository/base/head, a hashed worktree identity, branch, staged and unstaged changes, untracked source, root and applicable nested AGENTS instructions, and both baseline and changed policy text. Contract pins/ReleaseSets include their public version information; dependency manifests are fingerprinted without copying potentially private registry settings. The bundle records `publisher_trust=unverified` and `library_usage=not_checked`, never that an Agent understood it. Regenerate after changing scope, base, lock, branch/worktree, or session; no receipt is committed into a shared JSON file.

Module descriptors use exact paths or directory `/**` patterns. Impact is the union of baseline and candidate descriptors plus reverse dependencies. Deleting, renaming or shrinking a descriptor cannot subtract baseline scope/tests. Unknown non-document paths select all modules and require a full fallback; missing baseline governance, missing instructions and unmapped surfaces remain explicit blockers. Descriptor references check file existence, **not** actual route registration or ACL behavior.

The descriptors do not constitute a complete runtime registration audit. The local suite adapters use fixed Node arguments, never descriptor shell commands or package hooks. `governance.unit` runs the contribution-tools tests without database credentials. Runtime adapters require operator-provisioned, disposable PostgreSQL and an **explicit** `TEST_DATABASE_URL` for the CLI, or `testDatabaseUrl` for the library; there is no database discovery or default fallback. Accepted URLs name an `fp_*` database on loopback, optionally with a single absolute Unix-socket `host` parameter. Passwords, remote hosts, duplicate/query connection overrides and non-test database names are rejected. This admission check does not establish that a server is disposable: the operator must provide an isolated test-only server, never a production service that happens to have a matching name. Runtime tests own fresh `fp_*` schemas/roles and their teardown; forced termination can leave test data to clean up on that disposable server.

The fixed registry in `runtime-suites.mjs` maps these existing IDs:

| Suite | Direct runtime test files (without `.test.ts`) |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime.command-core` | `command-core` |
| `runtime.resource-scopes` | `resource-scopes` |
| `runtime.scoped-member-command` | `scoped-member-command` |
| `runtime.avatar` | `avatar`, `image-runtime`, `image-cloudflare` |
| `runtime.member-card` | `member-ecard`, `member-directory`, `social-links` |
| `runtime.work` | `flows`, `benefits`, `co-creation` |
| `runtime.work-privacy` | `work-privacy` |
| `runtime.full` | All baseline runtime files **plus newly added** direct `tests/runtime/*.test.ts` files |

`runLocalSuite(root, id, {testDatabaseUrl})` remains available from `verify.mjs`; `runLocalSuites(root, ids, {testDatabaseUrl})` and the default `verifyWorkspace(options, {testDatabaseUrl})` batch overlapping runtime selections into **one** Node/tsx invocation. Each file executes once even when full and subset IDs are selected; reports project each suite's file/case evidence from that invocation. There is no persistent cache across calls or source changes. Deleting a baseline file or a fixed subset file cannot become green; consumers without these producer suites receive `suite_files_unavailable`. New direct runtime test files are discovered automatically without first adding them to the baseline list. The tsx loader comes from the installed tooling's dependency resolution; no npm script is executed.

The subprocess environment contains only the existing small OS/locale allowlist and, for runtime alone, the validated explicit test URL. Home/provider credentials, PG defaults, `DATABASE_URL`, Node preload hooks and parent test context are not inherited. Execution is bounded to 60 seconds for governance and 15 minutes for runtime, with a 16 MB combined stdout/stderr cap; a library caller may only shorten the timeout. POSIX timeout kills the test process group (Windows kills the runner; use an external job/container boundary there). Timeout, process failure, malformed/incomplete reports, zero tests, skips, TODOs and cancellations cannot pass. Missing DB/loader/files and unknown IDs remain `not_run`; governance can still run when runtime has no DB.

A custom reporter consumes [Node test events](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/test.html#event-testsummary). Reports record selected paths, per-file counts and case-identity digests/statuses, reconciling case totals with file and global counts. Case identities hash source location and runner IDs, not potentially sensitive test names; errors, assertions, stdout/stderr and the database URL are omitted. The evidence digest covers the sanitized structured reporter output. Aborted/malformed runs retain selected paths but cannot claim complete case evidence. This reporter is local, candidate-controlled code: structured events avoid accidental stdout/TAP confusion, **not adversarial spoofing**. These records are not authenticated host observations and are never fed into `verifyHostCandidate` automatically. The runner is not a security sandbox: local tests retain the current OS user's filesystem/network rights; untrusted PR code requires an isolated, secret-free runner and an independent harness/publisher.

Separate `suite_events` retain describe/suite statuses, because Node's test counts exclude skipped suites. Any skipped/TODO/cancelled/failed suite also fails verification; suites never inflate the real test count. New approved runtime files should be added to the central baseline list to retain deletion protection in later revisions, even though new files run automatically on discovery.

Runtime registration/behavior coverage and missing baseline governance remain explicit blockers even after every selected test passes. This increment does not close the actual surface-registration audit or enable trusted merge/execution authorization.

The reviewed `consumer.agent-kit` adapter runs the real consumer's direct
`tests/*.test.mjs` files with the same bounded Node reporter and a fixed
`tests/workspace.test.mjs` deletion-protected baseline. It has no TypeScript
loader, package hooks or database environment; it uses the 60-second non-runtime
budget. New consumer tests are discovered, and missing/empty/skipped tests fail
closed. This is a local consumer regression check, not Agent execution authority,
an authenticated upstream release, or a replacement for surface auditing.

During initial adoption, running against an `origin/main` without descriptors correctly returns `baseline_governance_unavailable`. Do not change the base to hide that result in PR evidence. Synthetic repositories with an established baseline test the successful path. The export command also supplies the same central context library and a thin `scripts/freedom.mjs` to consumers; each consumer must supply reviewed module descriptors and actual suite adapters.

An explicit export, after committing all source files, remains:

```sh
node scripts/export-contract-bundle.mjs /absolute/path/to/consumer
```

The destination must already exist and must not overlap the producer. Export checks committed bytes and destination paths before writing. It copies the preview bundle, central tooling and thin consumer entrypoints, then writes the existing v1 lock last. It does not remove unrelated files, commit, open a PR or push. Interruption can leave a partial export; rerun the same committed export and verify before using it.

In a consumer, `node scripts/verify-contracts.mjs` returns structured JSON and exits 0 for the requested local verification, 1 for invalid input/integrity, or 2 for unavailable trust/source. `--remote` additionally compares v1 bytes with the exact pinned GitHub commit. v2 does not accept `--remote` as a replacement for publisher approval.

## ReleaseSet and proof profile

`freedom.release-set/v1` binds source SHA, artifact bytes/digests, contract families, libraries, policy revision, generator, fixtures and runtime profiles. Every artifact must be classified and every reference must resolve. Paths, counts and total bytes are bounded; absolute/traversal/Windows-special paths, case collisions, symlinks, hardlinks, extra files and missing files are rejected.

The digest profile is `sha256-exact-bytes/v1`: SHA-256 of the exact UTF-8 manifest bytes. The authoring helper sorts object keys and artifact paths for repeatability, but this encoding is **not RFC 8785**. It does not change historical preview/SQL digests or select the future execution JCS implementation.

`freedom.release-proof/v1` is detached. Ed25519 signs the UTF-8 bytes of `freedom.release-set-signature/v1` followed by one NUL byte and the exact manifest bytes. The signature uses unpadded canonical base64url. The public key must be an Ed25519 public JWK; no private key, HMAC key, arbitrary algorithm, jku or x5u is accepted. The implementation uses Node's native Ed25519 verification, with a null algorithm as required by its [crypto API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/crypto.html#cryptoverifyalgorithm-data-key-signature-callback).

This signature proves possession of an approved publisher key over a specific manifest. It does not itself prove a GitHub workflow ran. Workflow/provenance enforcement, secure signer custody and independent approval/revocation publication remain separate GOV-C/D work.

## Independent trust input

`verifyContractPin` accepts an operator-supplied `trustProfile`; it never discovers one in the candidate repository. The profile identifies environment, version, approved publisher keys, supported/withdrawn manifest digests and policy revisions. It expires, with a default maximum freshness window of 24 hours. The operator must obtain it from an authenticated, independently managed source. A self-consistent consumer hash and self-signed key are not approval.

There is no production trust profile or private signing key in this repository. The bootstrap CLI intentionally has no `--trust` flag: v2 is unavailable there until a trusted host injects the approved policy through the library API. `fixture` environment results remain fixture evidence; every result has `assurance_level=local` and `execution_authorized=false`.

The verifier checks only the supplied artifact set and policy. A build analyzer must independently collect actual library resolution records; `verifyLibraryResolution` validates those records but does not attest who collected them. `library_usage=not_checked` on a pin result is intentional.

## Boundaries

The governance validator implements only the fixed schema keyword subset used here and rejects unknown keywords. It is not a general JSON Schema engine and does not load candidate schemas or code. JSON parsing rejects duplicate keys, invalid UTF-8/surrogates, unsafe numbers and excessive depth/size. Errors expose stable codes, not input fragments or secret-bearing paths.

Trusted CI must run the fixed verifier against an isolated, immutable checkout with no production secrets. Filesystem checks do not make a concurrently hostile workspace a sandbox. Local candidate tests and reports cannot publish trusted CI status. No new runtime endpoints, tables or execution permissions are enabled by this package.

## Host-owned verification boundary (local GOV-C increment)

`packages/contribution-tools/trusted-ci.mjs` provides `verifyHostCandidate` for a
future independently managed host. It is deliberately absent from the consumer
export list and local CLI. The host must approve and load an immutable verifier
installation **before** accepting candidate data. `installedVerifierDigest()`
fingerprints the complete static module/schema import closure; comparing that
digest inside an already compromised process cannot establish trust. The host
also owns the Git executable, environment, object store, policy and observation
transport. Candidate runners must have no write access to any of them.

The input has exactly five fields:

- `objectRepository`: absolute path to a host-owned, complete bare Git object
  repository populated through a separately authenticated, bounded acquisition
  step. Do not point this at a candidate-created bare repository or copy its
  configuration. This library performs no fetch or checkout. It disables replace
  refs, ambient Git configuration and lazy fetches, rejects grafts/alternates,
  and applies bounded Git subprocess time/output limits.
- `binding`: independently acquired repository, positive PR number, run ID,
  exact base/head/candidate commits and candidate tree. A head candidate must
  contain the base; an integration candidate must have exactly the base and head
  as its ordered parents. This is a narrow local topology profile, not a claim
  that every GitHub merge-queue topology is supported.
- `policyBytes` and `expectedPolicy`: independently approved exact policy bytes
  and their revision/SHA-256. `freedom.trusted-ci-policy/v1` contains repository,
  source repository/commit/ReleaseSet digest, verifier commit/install digest,
  workflow identity/commit/publisher, nonempty required and fallback suite lists,
  and the allowed suite ID/harness-digest registry. Unknown keys and arbitrary
  commands are rejected. The host must independently enforce policy freshness
  and revocation; candidate policy files cannot update this input.
- `observations`: records from an authenticated host adapter for an isolated
  runner, **never** JSON artifacts supplied by the candidate. Each record binds
  the full repository/PR/run/base/head/candidate/tree/source/ReleaseSet/policy/
  verifier tuple, expected workflow publisher/revision and harness digest. A
  positive real test count, success, and zero failures/skips/cancellations are
  required. The evidence digest identifies the adapter's retained evidence; it
  is not a signature or proof of its origin. Missing suites return `unavailable`;
  duplicate/unexpected suites, changed bindings and invalid results are rejected.

The verifier recomputes changed paths from immutable tree entries, including
deletions, renames and mode-only changes. It unions baseline and candidate module
descriptors and reverse dependencies using the installed selector. Candidate
descriptor changes cannot subtract baseline tests or host-required suites;
paths without baseline ownership add host fallback suites even when a new or
expanded candidate descriptor claims them. Candidate descriptors are bounded data,
not executable policy. The candidate's v2 lock and manifest must match the
host-approved source and ReleaseSet digest. Actual immutable vendor blobs must
match the manifest/lock artifact paths, exact file set, byte counts and digests;
the detached proof must match its lock digest. This step does not replace the
existing detached-signature/publisher verification, actual source approval, library
resolution, route registration or behavioral tests; the independent host must
require the appropriate harnesses when integrating those checks.

See `test/trusted-ci.test.mjs` under contribution-tools for the exact synthetic
host policy and adapter record shapes. The tests exercise fake `echo pass`
workflows/reports, a replaced candidate verifier, descriptor deletion/shrinking,
empty/unknown suites, zero/skipped/cancelled/failing tests, same-name wrong-source
workflows, changed harness/policy/base/run/tree/source, Git graph overrides and
candidate symlinks. Test fixtures mint observations directly to test the local
boundary; they do not authenticate an external runner.

Reports retain `assurance_level=local`, `publisher_trust=unverified`,
`merge_authorized=false` and `execution_authorized=false`, even when all supplied
host observations pass this boundary. There is no authenticated CI adapter,
isolated runner provisioning, trusted check publication, GitHub protection,
production signing or completed GOV-C/D enforcement in this increment. Existing
local CLI and preview/v1 compatibility remain unchanged; this host-only profile
requires v2 source pins and does not silently promote preview/v1 to trusted CI.

## Implementation evidence

On 2026-10-02, the first local implementation passed 88 Node tests with no skips. The existing preview build regenerated 32 operations and 9 bundle artifacts with no changes under `contracts/preview/v1` or `packages/sdk`.

The context increment passed 106 Node tests, zero skips, including baseline/candidate scope, deleted rules, nested context, branch/worktree changes, stale workspace/base, secret-free subprocess environment, bounded report writes, zero/skipped/forged test output and three independently initialized synthetic consumer repositories. Existing contract tests passed 659 cases with 4 pre-existing skips (clock cases with fewer than three schema paths). These fixtures do not mean the real Agent Kit, client or other consumer repos have been upgraded.

The host-boundary increment passed 119 Node governance tests, zero skips,
including 13 new synthetic bare-repository/host-observation cases. The local
profile covers immutable candidate binding, pinned installed code/policy,
baseline-owned fallback and exact vendor integrity. It does not supply the
authenticated observations or GitHub enforcement described above.

The evidence supports the local portions of GOV-01/02/03/22, path/input safety and v1 compatibility; it does not mark those full product requirements passed. Release-proof purpose tests are not execution-token tests. Three real consumer checkouts, TS/Rust conformance, Windows/macOS, trusted GitHub checks, production publishers and runtime rejection remain unverified. All source acceptance rows remain `not_run` until their complete required evidence exists.
